Days Calculator App :

The app checks for the validity of the inputs, like the first date should precede the second one.
Also, it performs various checks on the range of the days and months.

Once a valid input is given, the number of days are calculated by using a logic mentioned using comments in the code.

Any errors are displayed in the textfield, else it gives the result.

Also, the difference between Gregorian and Julian calendar is not taken into consideration. So for the Julian dates, the app provides you a result that differs by 10 days.
